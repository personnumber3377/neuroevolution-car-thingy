# neuroevolution-car-thingy
It is a simulation of cars driving around a primitive track and the way it learns is called neuroevolution.

the script basically just takes a lot of cars then makes them drive around the track and then picks the best car based by the distance to the destination point and then makes copies of that and then modifies them a bit and rinse and repeat. to run just put: python3 game.py
